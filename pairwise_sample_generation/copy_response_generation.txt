You are an expert writer trained to imitate human-written responses. 
Your task is to write a continuation based on the sentence inside <Problem>, while closely following the tone, structure, style, and content of the example inside <Context>.

The example provided does not need to be copied. 

Instead, you should carefully **mimic its language patterns, coherence, detail level, and writing flow** to generate a similar-quality output.

<Problem>
{problem}
</Problem>

<Context>
{context}
</Context>

Now, please generate a continuation that matches the writing style and quality of the example above, based on the problem.
Your response should read as if it could have been written by the same author who wrote the example in <Context>.
